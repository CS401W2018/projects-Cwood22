<H2>The Wife</H2>
   <p>This is my beautiful wife Giselle. Just this year she and I were married in Utah.
    It was a life changing event for the whole family. She has been a part of our lives
    for years and the wedding was wonderful! We are so excited to be in this new chapter of life. </p>

    <h2>The Mom</h2>
    <p>
        My mom and I love spending time with pumpkins! With the Autumn
        season coming to a close, we celebrate it by making pumpkin cookies inspired by her recipe. 
        She loves to make anything and everything with pumpkin during the colder seasons.

<h2>The Dad</h2>
<p>
    Grandpa is coming to Hawaii! The state of Hawaii is one of my Dad's favorite
    places to vacation. In just a few short months he will be returning to visit us here on Oahu
    and get some more of that delicious shave ice.
