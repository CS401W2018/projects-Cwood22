        <h3>Photography from the beginning.</h3>
        Photography is more than just pointing and shooting.
        The first photograph was taken more than 200 years ago in 1826.
        Since then, photography has become a hobby, a profession, and even a lifestyle.
        <br>
        <h3>What is photography like today?</h3>
        In our day, the complicated and intriquite systems that allowed for the first
        photograph to be taken are combined delecately into the palms of our hands.
        With an iphone we can take pictures that, even twenty years ago, would be extraordinary.
        Despite all of us having a camera in our pockets, do we really know how digital photographs work?
        <br>
        <h3>How does digital photography work?</h3>
        Digital photographs are taken when light enters into the sensor of the camera.
        The image sensor is a light sensitive device that converts light into electrical signals that
        can then be read by the operating system to depict colors, details, and every pixel!
        <h3>More than art</h3>
        Photography is more than art. It tells us a story and gives us a chance to capture memories forever.
        I love photography. I love to be able to share photos from all over the world.
        Photos give me a way by which I can share things I would never be able to
        adequately describe.
