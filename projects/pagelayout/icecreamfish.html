When I first arrived at BYUH campus I was greeted
with the peculliar urge to taste 7-11 cuisine. As I investigated the offerings of this
fine establishment my wife and I decided we needed to try.

    One evening we took a trip over to the 7-11 in Hauula
    and came across a fish made of ice cream. This was not anything that
    we had seen before.
    We carefully examined its label and realized it would be the perfect
    unhealthy snack to have after dinner. 
    After we ate our delicious meal, we chowed down on some ice cream fish.
