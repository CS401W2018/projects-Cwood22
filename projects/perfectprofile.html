    <h1>Caleb Wood</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born in Utah and have lived there for the 
        majority of my life. The many years of snow
        and feeling like I was in a bubble made me want to leave Utah and explore
        the world. Thus my nature took me to apply to BYUH rather than taking the
        traditional path of BYU Provo. 
        I have only been here for a short time and have loved developing new interests
        and a different life than I previously. <br> </p> 
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My interests often vary year by year as time passes by.
    With that said there are some that I have carried with me throughout my
life. I love to make <em>YouTube</em> videos. Only recently has my channel grown but
ever since I was ten years old I loved making videos. The content of said videos varies
but these days contains one of my other interests, <strong>Lego.</strong> <br>I got into Lego when I was quite young around the age of eight.
    Since then it has been something I have loved to use to create, build, and collect.
    In addition to Lego I also enjoy spending my time on the beach with my wife,
    eating at delicious restuarants, and cooking my own great food.</p>
<H2>Some of my <mark>favorite</mark> dishes to cook are...</H2>
