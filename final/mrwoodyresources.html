                From my OG channel circle to my new branding today, I have used a lot of different assets and products to get here. <br>
                This is where you'll all the resources I use so you can see how my videos get made!

             <p>The infamous turntable! You may have noticed this turntable in nearly all my videos and shorts. It is a staple of my channel that started back in the Summer of 2024.
                I found it at Target in the lower-priced section of items. I would highly suggest something like this or a stand if you are planning on showing off smaller items in videos like minifgures!

                <p>This is the camera that I use to film the vast majority of my videos. If you want to film 4K video with better clarity than your typical iPhone,
                    I would highly suggest upgrading to something like this. The Canon 90D is a DSLR camera so it also excels in photo quality too. If you are looking for something for just video,
                    I would suggest checking out a mirrorless option that will be much lighter weight and a bit more portable.

                This is the Rode Video Mic NTG. <br>
                It's the microphone that I have used for a very long time in the majority of my videos.
                This microphone is pretty good if you use it correctly but I have had long standing issues with it that never seem to go away.
                I would recommend watching videos or learning about this BEFORE you think of purchasing.
                You can find information about it on Rode's webpage for it <a href="https://rode.com/en-us/microphones/on-camera/videomic-ntg?srsltid=AfmBOoq7zpNUcdrulLwKUL3XlbxRDMX0NmSmZ8jatZm5FDOtqMrsmb-5">Here</a>. <br>

                    This lightsaber was sent to me bt my friends over at <a href="https://www.damiensaber.com/collections/sabers-for-padawan?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAmMC6BhA6EiwAdN5iLQWlBV38bwsHPY1t4_A6vHkBcDIMTfBMpTftanjHWxCp7Sad6e_isBoCS7IQAvD_BwE">Damien Saber</a>
                    and I have used it ever since in my videos as a prop and as a piece of lighting equipment! If you are ever wondering how I get those dark red or bright lights in the background, it's probably my lightsaber!
