                From the very beginning of the channel to 17K subscribers, I have used a lot of tools over the years <br>that have helped me to become a better creator. <br>
                If you want to know how it all gets made, check out what I have pictured down below!

                <img src="turntable-site.jpg" alt="An image of a colorful turntable">
             <p>The infamous turntable! You may have noticed this turntable in nearly all my videos and shorts. It is a staple of my channel that started back in the Summer of 2024.
                I found it at Target in the lower-priced section of items. I would highly suggest something like this or a stand if you are planning on showing off smaller items in videos like minifgures!

                <img src="camera-site.jpg" alt="Image of a Canon 90D camera">
                <p>This is the camera that I use to film the vast majority of my videos. If you want to film 4K video with better clarity than your typical iPhone,
                    I would highly suggest upgrading to something like this. The Canon 90D is a DSLR camera so it also excels in photo quality too. If you are looking for something for just video,
                    I would suggest checking out a mirrorless option that will be much lighter weight and a bit more portable.

            <p>
                This is the Rode Video Mic NTG. <br>
                It's the microphone that I have used for a very long time in the majority of my videos.
                This microphone is pretty good if you use it correctly but I have had long standing issues with it that never seem to go away.
                I would recommend watching videos or learning about this BEFORE you think of purchasing.
                You can find information about it on Rode's webpage for it <a href="https://rode.com/en-us/microphones/on-camera/videomic-ntg?srsltid=AfmBOoq7zpNUcdrulLwKUL3XlbxRDMX0NmSmZ8jatZm5FDOtqMrsmb-5">Here</a>. <br>
                I would also highly suggest taking a look at <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/rode-videomic-ntg">this</a> review by <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/rode-videomic-ntg">PCmag.com</a> about it to understand the pros and cons a bit more.

                    The LEGO Lightsaber! <br>
                    This lightsaber was sent to me bt my friends over at <a href="https://www.damiensaber.com/collections/sabers-for-padawan?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAmMC6BhA6EiwAdN5iLQWlBV38bwsHPY1t4_A6vHkBcDIMTfBMpTftanjHWxCp7Sad6e_isBoCS7IQAvD_BwE">Damien Saber</a>
                    and I have used it ever since in my videos as a prop and as a piece of lighting equipment! If you are ever wondering how I get those dark red or bright lights in the background, it's probably my lightsaber!
                    The specific lightsaber I have is right <a href="https://www.damiensaber.com/products/damiensaber-lightsaber-argo-light-saber-lego-rgbx3-0-16-sound-fonts-short-hilt-23cm-no137?_pos=1&_sid=07c020eb0&_ss=r">here</a>.

             <p>
                The monitor I use is nothing fancy. It's a curved Acer monitor powered by a Cyberpower PC. <br>
                Ever since I moved from my original setup, this is what I have been using. It isn't what I love but it has worked well enough for me for these past few months.
                When I get more established in a home I will end up making some upgrades.
                If you want detailed specs on the PC go <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/cyberpowerpc-gamer-xtreme-gaming-desktop-intel-core-i5-14400f-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-8gb-1tb-ssd-black/6575072.p?skuId=6575072&utm_source=feed&ref=212&loc=20987460398&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAD-ORIi1tYqln8SR9RW_TB4JileX0&gclid=CjwKCAiAmMC6BhA6EiwAdN5iLS3deC6eTcgb-7zvhJHoOy0pCtn7F7JnkONr1aW0zzwSY3kKo8lAsRoCIowQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">here</a>.

                <img src="ringlight-site.jpg" alt="Image of a Canon 90D camera">
                <p>This is a ringlight I use to light my face in my livestreams. I use it on occasion in my videos but the light just isn't as bright as I would have wanted it to be.
                    It is a very budget-friendly ringlight from UBEESIZE. Their products are generally reliable and if you are on a budget and willing to make a few sacrifices, this would suit you well.

            <img src="figures-site.jpg" alt="An image of a group of LEGO and MEGA minifgures">
            <p>
                All of these minifigures are an underrated part of my resources. I truthfully would not be able to make the videos I do without LEGO and MEGA and all the minifigures I own!
                These figures specifically appear in the background of my shorts very often. They're a subtle way in which I nod to the community and show my appreciation for what I have.

                    And last but not least, my channel circle, banner, and all the branding I have created for YouTube. These things take hours for me to create and perfect and often go unnoticed.
                    The truth is, my channel branding is as much for me as it is for YouTube. I love that I get to create my persona on the web using these elements. I hope you enjoy the branding!
