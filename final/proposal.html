    <li>The title for topic of my site will be MrwoodyHQ a place for my youtube subscribers to learn about me, view my latest updates, and find merch.
    </li>
    <li>
        I chose this topic because I wanted a way to better connect with my YouTube audience as well as create more outreach to others. I want it to be
        similar to a blog that is more about me personally away from the YouTube videos. I also want it to be a place where I can market upcoming projects, sell merchandise,
        and build my personal brand.
    </li>
    <li>
        On the homepage I will have the latest news and information surrounding uploads and merchandise drops. It will include an about me in the footer as well as links to my social channels.
        The other pages will consist of a shop, letting fans look through merchandise, channel items I am selling off, and other things. 
        There will be a page dedicated to fan posts, latest comments, and news.
        There will be a page with A form to submit ideas and requests, as well as send fan messages straight to me and for businesses to contact me about potential sponsorships.
        I will collect names, comment types and optional emails in order for people to connect with me personally or for business. 
        There will be a final page that uses a table to makeup a calendar that shows the times when I am posting content, going live, or dropping new items.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the about me section I will include a reference to YouTube that will take people to the wiki page to learn how it was founded. 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#:~:text=YouTube%20is%20an%20American%20online,three%20former%20employees%20of%20PayPal.">Learn about Youtube</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        I will also include a reference to the products that I use most in my videos like LEGO and Halo to credit to those groups. <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/aboutus">About LEGO</a>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(franchise)">About Halo</a>
