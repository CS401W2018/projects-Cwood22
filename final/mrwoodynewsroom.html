                Christmas is upon us everyone! <br> Today I finally got to build my LEGO Christmas tree that has been sitting in the box for the past 12 months.
                It was quite the fun building experience to say the least. <br>
                Merry Christmas everyone!
                <br>

                The delicious ice! <br>This may not be very LEGO news related, but taking a break from YouTube today to enjoy some shave ice.
                If you have never had Matsumoto's like this, you are certainly missing out. 
                In other news, working on plans for our future discord and creating new video ideas has been taking a bunch of my time for the last few weeks. Good things are coming!<br>

                Birthday celebrations are the best. <br> LEGO Minecraft just released this buildable birthday cake inside the Pig Birthday set.
                Out of all the builds in the set this has to be one of my favorites. They did a great job getting all the pixels right on this one and they even used
                the new-ish candle piece to make the flame in the middle look perfect. 10/10

                Have you been tuning into the streams?
                <br>
                It has been a little bit since I've been able to do a proper LEGO Minecraft stream. The issues with internet connection and a whole bunch of timing problems has left me pretty discouraged.
                Rest assured if I can ever get the internet connection to work properly, you'll see some more awesome LEGO Minecraft streams over on YouTube
