            YouTube analytics souce, YouTube viewers watch roughly 5 billions hours of videos every day! <br>
            Thats a whole lot of MrBeast vidoes right? With the amount of hours people spend on YouTube, it is no wonder that so many people want to try making videos for themselves! I am not a YouTube expert by any means but I have learned a lot in my time both watching and creating on the platform.
            One question I notice often is how do you grow on YouTube? The answer to this question is simple yet profound. <br>
            You have to start and keep going! In the midst of the billions of hours of video uploaded daily, there is still a spot for you on the platform. You just have to get to work!
            It's easier said than done, I know. But trust me, the best thing you can do to keep going on YouTube is to get started and keep moving.

        <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
        <div>
        <h5>Why YouTube</h5>
        <p>
            Way back in 2013 I had a dream of becoming a YouTuber. Being young at the time, I was an ipad kid before it was cool and I spent a ton of time watching YouTube. 
            YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ryanhiga">Ryan Higa</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rhettandlink/featured">Rhett and Link</a>, and a whole bunch of others inspired me to
            create whatever I could imagine.
        </p>

        <div>
        <h5>What to Know</h5>
        <p>Here I will share a few of my tips to creating content for YouTube and other platforms. My goal is to inform you all of my progress on the platform as well as to give you some
            insight as to how you could start posting too!
        </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h5>The Right Reasons</h5>
            <p>We all see some of the largest creators on the platform share amazing content. Oftentimes these creators have made YouTube their full time job and even career!
                What the vast majority of these creators have in common is passion. <br>
                The biggest names in the industry are very dedicated to their craft, and they enjoy what they do. 
                If you want to start out as a content creator, that is a mindset I suggest you embrace!
                YouTube can be a very lucrative endeavor, but if you are making videos solely for the purpose of earning money, you may find that you lose passion for itâ€”especially when things don't go as planned or you aren't making the kind of money you want.
                If you truly have a passion for video creation, meaning you find it enjoyable, creative, and a good use of time, then you are ready to start making great videos!

            <h5>Starting Out</h5>
            <p>
                <div class="spacer">Now, I cannot stress enough the importance of what I am about to say &#8595;</div>
                <div class="spacer">When you start making videos, BE CONFIDENT</div>
                When I started all those years ago, people around me made fun of me for what I created. (Lego YouTube wasn't as fancy back then as it is now.)
                After feeling discouraged because of what others would say I deleted every single video I created foreever. Then I stopped creating.
                If I could go back I would have encouraged my younger self to be confident and to create what I wanted to create regardless of what other people say.
                These days the harshest feedback I get isn't from the people I know in the real world, but from people who see me in the digital one. We can't control what other people
                are willing to say online. Hateful comments, misinformation, and more will most likely end up in the comment section of your videos eventually. I encourage you to
                be kind, stay strong, and do your best to be confident in who you are. This will make you stand out as you make peace instead of contention.

                In this business, you get out of it what you put into it.
