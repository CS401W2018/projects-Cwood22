            YouTube analytics source, YouTube viewers watch roughly 5 billion hours of video every day! <br>
            That's a whole lot of MrBeast videos right? <br> 
            With the amount of hours people spend on YouTube, it is no wonder that so many people want to try making videos for themselves! 
            I am not a YouTube expert by any means, but I have learned a lot in my time both watching and creating on the platform. <br>
            One question I notice often is how do you grow on YouTube? The answer to this question is simple yet profound. <br>
            You have to start and keep going! <br> In the midst of the billions of hours of video uploaded daily, there is still a spot for you on the platform. <br>
             You just have to get to work!
            It's easier said than done, I know. But trust me, the best thing you can do to keep going on YouTube is to get started and keep moving.

        <h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
        <div>
        <h5>Why YouTube</h5>
        <p>
            Way back in 2013 I had a dream of becoming a YouTuber. Being young at the time, I was an ipad kid before it was cool and I spent a ton of time watching YouTube. 
            YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ryanhiga">Ryan Higa</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rhettandlink/featured">Rhett and Link</a>, and a whole bunch of others inspired me to
            create whatever I could imagine. <br>
            Before you start creating your own channel, there are definitely lots of things to consider.
            In this video <a href="https://youtu.be/uI8hzNEHku8?si=TnstsgpwH1ioXHpX">here</a>, Ryan Higa explains life of YouTube in a funny way. While much of what he says is satire, there is a lot of realism
            inside his thoughts. He talks about the rise and fall of emotional states, viewcounts, and so forth. <br>
            This is the side of YouTube that we often don't see. Even for small creators like myself, I have experienced some of the negative things he brings up in the video.
            I would definitely suggest giving the whole video a watch when you have time and keeping in mind that YouTube may not always be what it appears to be. <br>
            With that said though, YouTube really is an amazing platform and has helped thousands of creators find success and build wonderful communities. Yes, there are drawbacks at times, but the truth is, making YouTube videos is worth it.
        </p>

        <h5>What to Know</h5>
        <p>
            With YouTube, there are a few things you should know before getting started. If you are really wanting this to be your career, you're going to need to know how to start making money from YouTube. <br>
            For starters, YouTube guidelines state <a href="https://www.youtube.com/creators/how-things-work/video-monetization/#:~:text=Apply%20to%20the%20program%20and,in%20the%20last%2090%20days.">here</a> 
            that in order to start earning adsense from Google directly, you have to have at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours. This can seem like a very daunting task especially when, according to this CreatorlyMedia
            <a href="https://www.creatorlymedia.com/blog/why-90-of-youtube-channels-fail#:~:text=The%20reality%20is%2C%20the%20vast,never%20made%20it%20that%20far.">article</a>,</p>
            <div class="spacer">
            "Out of the 100 million YouTube creators, <br>
            only 10 million channels have surpassed 1000 subscribers"<a href="https://www.creatorlymedia.com/">(CreatorlyMedia).</a></div> <br>
            
            <p>This makes it seem like your odds for even getting to the point where you can earn on YouTube are very slim. While it can feel like that first, with persistence and dedication you can easily
            surpass 1,000 Subscribers and beyond! <br>
            Now that you know the threshold requirements, let's talk about why you may want to start a YouTube Channel in the first place.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h5>The Right Reasons</h5>
            <p>We all see some of the largest creators on the platform share amazing content. Oftentimes these creators have made YouTube their full time job and even career!
                What the vast majority of these creators have in common is passion.</p> <br>
               <div class="spacer">The biggest names in the industry are very dedicated to their craft, <br>and they enjoy what they do.</div> <br>
            <p>If you want to become a content creator, that is a mindset I suggest you embrace! <br>
                YouTube can be a very lucrative endeavor, but if you are making videos solely for the purpose of earning money, you may find that you lose passion for itâ€”especially when things don't go as planned or you aren't making the kind of money you want to be.
                If you truly have a passion for video creation, meaning you find it enjoyable, creative, and a good use of time, then you are ready to start making great videos!
            </p>

        <div>
            <h5>Starting Out</h5>
            <br>
            <div class="spacer">&#8595; Now, I cannot stress enough the importance of what I am about to say &#8595;</div>
            <div class="spacer">When you start making videos, BE CONFIDENT!</div>
            <p>
                When I started, all those years ago, people around me made fun of me for what I created. (Lego YouTube wasn't as fancy back then as it is now.)
                After feeling discouraged because of what others would say, I deleted every single video I created, forever. Then I stopped creating. <br>
                If I could go back I would have encouraged my younger self to be confident and to make the videos I wanted to regardless of what other people could say.
                These days the harshest feedback I get isn't from the people I know in the real world, but from people who see me in the digital one. We can't control what other people
                are willing to say online. Hateful comments, misinformation, and more will most likely end up in the comment section of your videos. <br> 
                I encourage you to be kind, stay strong, and to do your best to be confident in who you are. This will make you stand out as you make peace instead of contention. 
                This will also help you as you are starting out to focus on the fun of the journey rather than the destination. 
            </p>

            <h5>You Get What You Give</h5>
            <p>
                With YouTube (and most things in life) you get out of it what you put into it. <br>
                 In the context of YouTube, this means more than just creating
                the occassional short and self-promoting in Pewdiepie's comment section. There are lots of ways to find success on the platform but each of them requires time.
                You have to put in time to understand what you want to create, learn about how the algorithm works, and create something that is visually pleasing. <br>
                Watching educational videos from creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@vidIQ">VidIQ</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TubeBuddy">TubeBuddy</a>
                will help you understand YouTube a bit more. I personally enjoy their videos and go back to their tips quite often. Nothing beats being yourself on YouTube, but
                if you are stuck, see what they can teach you. <br>
                Do the best you can to give the most you can and you'll find that people see your charisma and hit that subscribe button!

        <div id="equipment-tips">
            <h5>Equipment</h5>
            <br>
            <div class="spacer">This is a list of equipment I would strongly suggest having as you begin your journey. <br> 
                If you need to start with just an iPhone, go for it!  </div>
                <br>
            <table class="equipmentlist">
                <thead><th>Equipment</th></thead>
                <tbody>
                <tr><td>A solid camera(at least 1080p)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Lighting Equipment</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Video Editing Software(Free software is great!)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Microphone</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Tripod</td></tr>
                <tr><td>That's it!</td></tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
                You could get by without everything in this list, <br>but you'll thank me if you start with some of this stuff earlier.
                If you want to know the specific equipment I generally use in my videos, go to the <a href="mrwoodynewsroom.html">Resources</a> page!

        <div>
            <h5>Go Do It!</h5>
            <p>
                From here, you've got this! <br>
                There's plenty more to learn and to create. So, get started! There's no better time than now to get out there and make the YouTube channel of your dreams.
                Rememeber to start small and do your best. <br>
                Good luck! - MrWoody
