        <p>When my first youtube channel was started way back in 2013, I also made 3 other "offshoot" YouTube channels that focussed on things I enjoyed at the time.
        The popular Minecraft game series, a joint channel with a friend, and Rainbow Loom channel were started and even had videos!
        Thankfully for our eyes as well as for my dignity, these videos and channels have since been repurposed or just completely removed from YouTube.</p>

        <p>Ever since YouTube was first created I watched amazing creators do the impossible. I was enthralled with these creators that took something they enjoyed and turned it into their life's work.
            My dream of becoming a YouTuber has been engrained in my head forever. With each step along my journey I continue face new challenges, but most importantly I will never give up.

        <p>
            My main channel, MrWoody, was created over 10 years ago in May 2013. Originally the channel went by a different name until years later it was changed to
            what we now see as MrWoodyYT. After starting to put more time into YouTube I found myself finding lots of success in YouTube shorts and enjoying creating content for thousands of viewers!
            My first short to hit over 1 Million views is all about one of my favorite things, LEGO. 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7l8MN-NyeZ4">This Video here</a> is one that got me lots of traction in the LEGO space as I voiced my opinion
            on the features of modern LEGO Star Wars sets. <br>
            From there, I started to grow and focus more on Shorts content. I have since created a TikTok page, an instagram page, and more.
            There are so manu new things I would like to create and accomplish on my YouTube journey. I hope you will come for the ride!
