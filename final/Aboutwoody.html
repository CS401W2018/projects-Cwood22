        <p>When my first youtube channel was started way back in 2013, I also made 3 other "offshoot" YouTube channels that focussed on things I enjoyed at the time.
        The popular Minecraft game series, a joint channel with a friend, and Rainbow Loom channel were started and even had videos!
        Thankfully for our eyes as well as for my dignity, these videos and channels have since been repurposed or just completely removed from YouTube.</p>

        <figcaption>Ever since YouTube was first created I watched amazing creators do the impossible. I was enthralled with these creators that took something they enjoyed and turned it into their life's work.
            My dream of becoming a YouTuber has been engrained in my head forever. With each step along my journey I continue face new challenges, but most importantly I will never give up.

    I'm MrWoody and I build LEGO, I play LEGO Minecraft, and I love hanging out with all of you! 
    Let's make our goal to show gratitude and love to each other despite our differences. I want to use our community for good!
    There are a ton of facets of LEGO that I love to explore and I also think that just because we love LEGO doesn't mean we can't love other brands too!
    LEGO AND HALO for all!
    My last name is also Wood, and I used to have a dog named Woody. So it fit perfectly.
