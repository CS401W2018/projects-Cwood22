    I learned that css grid and flex both accomplish similar things but in a different way.
    I learned about parent tags and how they interact with their children and then their children.
    I also learned that you can use css grid and flex in the same html (I originally thought it was only one or the other).
    I learned that flex is brother Slade's favorite type to use and that
    we can use create cards inside a page.

        An accessible website is one that is able to be accessed by a variety of people
        with varying ablities. It is a website that has special toosl to allow those with disabilities to 
        use and interact with the site. 
        On our end, we need to have an accessible website in order to allow anyone to be able to
        use our website and interact with it. It is also helpful in the event of creating a business website where
        legal matters may require a website to be accessible to as many people as possible.
