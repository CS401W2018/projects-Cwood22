            The biggest positive of hosting videos on youtube is that it is free to do. It is also fairly simple to embed them which is good as well.
            On the negative side there is a validation error that you have to correct and the video will encourage viewers to leave your site and watch on YouTube. Another negative is that
            YouTube will dipslay recommendations to the viewer for other videos that might show ads or videos you don't want the viewer to see.
