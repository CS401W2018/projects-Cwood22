The best kind of photos to encode with jpeg are continuos tone images with lots of colors that are still.
    </li>
    <li>
The best kind of photos to encode with GIF is moving or animated images that need a lossless format. They are limited in the colors.
    </li>
    <li>
        PNG is a lossless format that you can use to have a clear pixel background, access more colors, and add more detail. 
        They are not very ideal for web because these files are much larger. 
    </li>
    <li>
You can resize your photo using a css file and adding and ID to the &lt;img&gt;.
Then in your css you can use the id to change width and height. You can also also an outside program like photoshop before you add it into your html.
    </li>
    <li>
        You should resize photos using editing software instead of css because
        the files will still be large even when you resize them so they will still take a long time for other
        devices to dowload the photo on the web.
