            Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.
            Inline css is the css that is added to a tag inside of the tag itself.
            It only applies to whatever is in the specific tag. <br>Embedded is placed in the
            head tag and it can be applied to every single tag of a specific type on a page. <br>
            The external css, what we will be using, is css made from a style sheet that can influence
            style through a link inside the head tag. 
        </li>
        <li>
           We are using an external style sheet because it styles the entie website and
           that way we will get a consistent look over the entire site versus just one page.
        </li>
        <li>
            The selector is what is used to target specific elements we want to style using patterns
            to select elements.
