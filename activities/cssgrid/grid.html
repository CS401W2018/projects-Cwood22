During class I should focus on getting the understanding I need to be able to implement newly learned tools. Outside of class I should be learning about these tools

The main difference between css grid is that grid is 2 dimensional and flex is 1 dimensional but is still good at 2 dimensional.
The best difference is that the parent determins the size of the child. Flex is the oposite, the child tag determins its own size and figures out where to put things. Brother slade likes flex better.
