        You can select an item by using a tag name by using the tag like h1
        to select. That would select all tags in the webpage. If you just want the header h1 you can use parents
        child releations and add the parent before the tag. You can also give a tag an ID that will
        give you a specific tag for an ID. The better way us to use a "class" using a period and then the name of the tag.
        

    </li>
    <li>
An ID is only for a specific tag to be identified in the CSS. A class tag can give
a class to a tag that use periods to identify what the class is. Hashtags are used for ID. 
    </li>
    <li>
Span tags allow us to surround text in a tag to apply different properties. 
You can add classes and ID to span tags. Div tags are used to make larger groups of a selection to 
apply properties to.
    </li>
    <li>
A div tag is more basic and doesn't have a specific section like header tags, main tags, and footer tags.
Div is just a general grouping tag. 
    </li>
    <li>
You can select colors by using Hex codes, one character for red, blue and green, or using RGB255-0. You can also add an alpha channel, that is how opaque the color is.
