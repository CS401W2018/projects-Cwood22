        A block tag is a tag that has padding, margin, and a inline tag is one that sits inline with the other tags. &lt;img&gt; is an inline tag.
    </li>
    <li>
        block tag is almost all of the tags we use like 
        &lt;p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;and inline tags are others like  &lt;a&gt;
        and  &lt;img&gt;
    </li>
    <li>
        Normal flow in html is the way the page flows from one tag to another. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Float makes a tag float in the page like this image on the left. 
    </li>
    <li>
        To make nice navigation on mobile you can use css to make the buttons area that you click larger. This is done by adding padding to the links and borders.

        Find videos to review on the canvas page for the class from the home page.
